# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am-5pm). This app will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Tasks are saved in local storage and can be cleared.

You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time.

## Usage

Users can utilise the calender to plan and schedule their busy work day hour by hour as well as view and save tasks. Users can view present tasks as well as future and past tasks inside 
the calender application.
